<h1 translate>Listener Details Help</h1>

<p translate>To create a listener, the port and protocol must be provided. If either of these properties are not provided, only the load balancer will be created.</p>
<p translate><strong>NOTE:</strong> The TERMINATED_HTTPS protocol is only available if the key-manager service is enabled and you have authority to list certificate containers and secrets.</p>
